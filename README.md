# Version 3.0.25
**Metacache database version updated for this update. You may experience slower loading of media lists in the immediate aftermath of this update as a result. It is advised to restart Kodi after this update.**
- Added inclusion of Extra Art images to "Set Artwork" menu. If Extra Art is enabled, you will now be able to choose an image for Posters, Fanarts, Clearlogos, Banners, Cleararts, Landscapes, Discarts (Movies), Keyarts (Movies).
- Added "Choose Audio Properties to Exclude" to Results->Sorting & Filtering. Here you can choose audio properties to exclude from results i.e. Dolby Atmos, 6CH Audio etc.
- Added honoring of "Reset Progress" status for Trakt watched (& Progress) lists.
- Added "Secondary Language" to subtitles settings. Set this and Fen will search for subs in this language if it fails to find results in your Primary Language. Default is "None", meaning no secondary search.
- Added "Prompt for Year in Search" to Settings->Metadata->Search. This will allow for a year to be entered when searching for a Movie or TV Show. The year can be left blank if you don't know it. Default is ON.
- "Results Display Style" setting has been reset & renamed to "Results Display Format" for this update. Formats for results have been limited to the previously named "Contrast" formats. This will enable me to make more style formats in the future without having to double up on the code, and possibly add skin specific xml files.
- Substantial changes to metadata code. A version bump for metadata cache is therefore required.
- Couple of changes to settings. "Extras" settings moved to "Navigation" tab, and new settings for "Custom Actions" added to "Navigation" tab.
- Some changes to direct search results for Fen and Easynews. Added duration info to results and also made the formatting more standard.
- Fixed IMDb Keyword Search.
- Other changes/fixes.
